# functional
Extremely minimal functional library with a focus on source-code clarity.
Design goals are simple:

1. clear auto-detected function signatures in most IDEs,
2. implementations that are easy to debug, and
3. haskell-style function.signature strings in all exported functions.

Clarity and function signatures will result in more code duplication, but I feel the trade-off is worth it.
